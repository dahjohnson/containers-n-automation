# More Kubernetes: ConfigMaps and PersistentVolumes

## Objectives:

### Deploy two Deployments with two Pods, each running the nginx image.
### Include ConfigMaps that point to two different custom index.html pages.
### Create a service that points to both deployments. Confirm reachability to both using the same IP address and port number.
### Create a persistent storage manifest that gets approx. 250MB of disk space on the host node in the /temp/k8s directory. Then, create a corresponding persistent storage claim manifest file.
